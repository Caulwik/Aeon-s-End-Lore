Wave 1 cards:
+ Jade (gem): Jade is an common as bone at the [[Cave Mouth|mouth of the cave]].
+ Diamond Cluster (gem): These gems were once the most precious, the most scarce. Now they line the walls of caves like shimmering fangs.
+ Oblivion Swell: Many folk have made their fortune harvesting gems. The very breaches through which [[Nameless|The Nameless]] come bestow the stones with strange properties.
+ Blasting Staff: While appearing to be crudely fashioned, these staffs contain within them the very essence of the [[Void]].
+ Mage's Talisman (relic): The sister-mages of old would wear their talismans as a symbol of their station and a warning to those that would challenge them.
+ lay Waste (Basic Attack): Gravehold sat silent and forgotten for a thousand ages before The Nameless came. No one remembers for whom this vast city was built. Those stories lay in the ash outside the cave with the bones of those who once told them.
+ Overwhelm ([[Horde-Crone]] Attack): "In [[The World That Was]], there were myths of ancients, now lost to us, that walked the primordial wastes. They built Gravehold as a sanctuary from the chaos. The elders called them troggs."
+ Vitrify ([[Blight Lord]] attack): "The elders of Gravehold thought it wise to pave the streets of the [[Dirt Market]] in tumbled breach glass."
