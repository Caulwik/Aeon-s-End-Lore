#nemesis 
Rageborne is a nemesis from the [[Core set]].

Core set mat lore:
"_This war has waged for aeons now, so long that it is all we know. Our children learn to hold a blade soon after their first words are uttered. With each generation, the joy in their faces and voices diminish, every instinct sharpened to a single word: survive._
[[Malastar]] _believes The Nameless waited for us to become worthy foes before sending their champion, the one we call "Rageborne." It is their executioner, here to quicken_ [[Gravehold]]_'s end.Never have I seen such anger, all of it reflected into the dead eyes of the rabid beasts it commands.  
When the breaches open, the beggars in_ [[Chasmwalk]] _shout above the city bells: "The end is near! The end is near!" And in my hollow heart, I know the truth of it. The end was here since first The Nameless came. We only have prolonged it._"
