#nemesis
The Wayward One is a nemesis from the [[The Nameless]].

The Nameless mat lore:
"_This creature is an oddity, even amongst its odd kind, trapped in a place neither here nor there. The scouts first saw it from the west wall, flickering against the vault of the cave. They say it wailed as it fluttered through the city's defenses like a broken ghost. A merchant in the [[Dirt Market]] made the mistake of brushing the wisps of its floating form as she threw up her hands in horror. She began to fade away as soon as the dust of the thing sifted between her fingers. And then it too was gone.  
  
_Like us, it is lost. Of all The [[Nameless]] that have plagued us here in our last sanctum, the Wayward One alone seems almost tormented by the task. The breach mages say they show compassion toward the wretched thing by fighting against it with all their might, for like us, it is seeking an end to its struggle._"
