#nemesis 
Carapace Queen is a nemesis from the [[Core set]].

Core set mat lore:
"_The Carapace Queen, The Mother-Of-Husks, the Swarm Daughter - all these dread names we have chosen in our vain attempts to comprehend this creature. But of all The Nameless, the Queen has brought the most ruin upon_ [[Gravehold]]_, for her armies are vast and lethal, more clockwork things than beasts._
  
_There is a saying about the husks: "To kill one is to breed six." Only when the Queen retreats through the_ [[Void]] _do they relent, left to twitch and expire on the cave floor among the bodies of those they have overcome. After each siege, weeks are spent shoveling up the metallic scraps, which are carried deep into the bowels of the caves. There they are heaped in formless piles, their countenances unchanged in death beyond their stillness and dim eyes._"

Core set cards:
+ Broodwomb (Carapace Queen Minion): It is the husk-mother, spewing multitudes through the void into Gravehold.
+ Hatch (Carapace Queen Attack): The Queen wears her offspring like some writhing armor
+ Foul Multitudes (Carapace Queen Power): It took the survivors of Gravehold half-a-moon to shovel up the dead husks and carry them into [[The Depths (location)|the depths]], where they now lie in piles high enough to touch the top of the cave vaults.
+ Legion Beacon (Carapace Queen Power): Gravehold knows when the Queen is near, for the claxon call of her legions echoes throughout the cave.


Carapace Queen is the canonical progenitor of the later Nemesis, [[Maggoth]], which shares base artwork with the minion Broodwomb and features mechanics very similar to those of Carapace Queen.
