#nemesis 
Prince of Gluttons is a nemesis from the [[Core set]].

Core set mat lore:
"_The past was lost to us in many ways. First our world was taken, forcing the few that then survived into the black cold of the earth. For aeons, generations of survivors eked out meager lives in [[Gravehold]], the breach mages all the while honing their fell craft. For aeons, The Nameless would lay siege to the city, bringing us ever closer to extinction. But the cruelest stroke was in erasing our very history.  
  
_The Prince of Gluttons was the fourth of their kind to besiege the city. Even at the time, it seemed too easy to repel his attack and send The Prince lumbering back into the bright nothing of the breach. But soon those that survived the attack had forgotten the name of [[The World That Was]]. Wives stared into the empty eyes of their husbands and children with no memory of their love for one another. The old ways were lost, the words of The First Tribe mere symbols scratched upon scrolls, all of it devoured, obliterated from eternity. The Prince feeds on our very histories, leaving behind only our fear and doubt. We are a people with no past nor future, trapped only in the fleeting moments before our eyes._"

Core set cards:
