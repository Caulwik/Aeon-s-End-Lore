#nemesis 
Horde-Crone is a nemesis from [[The Depths]].

The Depths mat lore:
"_In the ancient time, before our kind, the troggs walked [[The World That Was]]. From what the elders remember of the lost tales, there were three great tribes, each with a purpose. The Yud were keepers of life, gifted in the art of creation, molders of flesh. The Orp were beings of shadow, masters of ruination and death, the counterweights on the scales of life, against which the Yud were balanced. And the Zom were neither light nor dark, but instead were dreamers with great minds.  
The world was unforgiving and empty then, but malleable, a great marble to be chiseled and shaped as they saw fit. And though the tribes were each different, they lived in great harmony. The world flourished and faded, developed and dreamed, much the way worlds are supposed to. Eventually the world they wove was complete and no longer needed them, so they journeyed into the black of this very cave, to this very city, to sleep and be forgotten.  
Now The Crone has stirred the troggs from their slumber. Awakened with new and malicious purpose, they issue from the infinite depths of the cave in their hordes, eager to take back their ancient city and undo their own great feats. And who are we but immigrants here in [[Gravehold]], in this world they made for us? Are we not their children in some measure? Is it not their right to take it all away?_"
