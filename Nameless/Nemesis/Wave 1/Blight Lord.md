The Blight Lord is a nemesis from the [[The Nameless]].

The Nameless mat lore:
"_The Blight Lord was the first of The Nameless to touch [[The World That Was]]. With a quick and deliberate hand, the great city of [[Karek]] was turned to a mountain of green glass, its many thousands of denizens entombed within. The harbor towns of [[M'hlark]] were next to fall, the warm waters lapping against the jagged, frozen shapes of those caught unaware. Even the very earth below its shadow became glass, left to shatter into crude and useless shapes._  
  
_The elder of the First Tribe bade his people to pay tribute, for in his ignorance he considered it a divine messenger from the gods they worshiped then. Of those that knelt before it, none were spared. And thus the Blight Lord was given its name, for the certain ruin of our people followed it like some merciless plague._"
