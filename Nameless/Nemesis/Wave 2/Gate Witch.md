#nemesis
The Gate Witch is a nemesis from [[War Eternal]].

War Eternal mat lore:
"_[[Yan Magda]] says, 'In the [[Void|void]] I saw the ragged face of the infinite. Your people call it the 'Gate Witch.' The infinite is the Witch's dominion, to bend, to break.  
'Time is like water,' [[Brama]] says. 'It flows through us, around us. Our lives are but drops of blood in a great confluence.' In my short years, I have seen the malice of time. Our future and past are but a red smear across its maw._  
_'The end is written in the ash of the beginning,' [[Phaedraxa]] proselytizes._  
_As I stare into the dim light of the [[Gravehold|city]], ruminating on the wisdom of these great women, the bells toll once more. I smell the burnt air of the breach, its heat upon my face. Another battle will ensue, and what may very well be our last._" ― [[Indira]]

Wave 2 lore:
+ Deep Abomination (Gate Witch Minion): "_It is said that each abomination is but the same creature from across all worlds twisted into a single form._"
