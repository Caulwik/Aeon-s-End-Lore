#nemesis 
Knight of Shackles is a nemesis from [[The Void]].

__The Void mat lore:__
"_[[Thraxir]] died before my time among the mages. He was said to be the bravest and most skilled warrior in all of [[Gravehold]]. Despite his skill, he met his end at the hands of [[Rageborne]], torn in twain like some fragile doll. Like all of our kind, he was buried shadow, tossed into [[the depths (location)|The Depths]] among generations of those fallen. To this very day, none have been given his mantle as commander.  
Some believe... [[Mist]] believes that [[Thraxir]] has returned as one of the very abominations he gave his life fighting. To her credit, the Knight seems to know our defenses all too well. Its mastery over the breaches is akin to that of our mages. It commands an army of the dead, each with eyes like mage's [[Gems|gems]]. Or is this all merely a coincidence, a ruse calculated by our foes? If Thraxir could be corrupted, can he also be saved?_" ― [[Indira]]

__Wave 2 lore:__
+ Chainsworn (Knight of Shackles Minion): "_It strode confidently among the dead upon its blighted steed, the glow of the breach radiating from it as they sieged the city._"
+ End of all (Knight of Shackles Power): "_[[Thraxir]] was once a breach mage commander, torn asunder by the one called [[Rageborne]]. Now he is a harbringer for The [[Nameless]], the end of all._"
+ Invade (Knight of Shackles Attack): "_The elders of [[Gravehold]] thought it wise to pave the streets of the [[Dirt Market]] in tumbled breach glass._"
