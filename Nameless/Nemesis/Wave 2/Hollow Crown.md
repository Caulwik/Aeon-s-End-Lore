#nemesis
The Hollow Crown is a nemesis from [[War Eternal]].

__War Eternal mat lore:__
"_There are dark forces at work within [[Gravehold]], machinations, schemes, conspiracies. Our numbers wane, even with the arrival of [[Yan Magda]] and her companions. Faith is the one thing that has kept us alive, and yet it is the very thing the Hollow Crown desires most.  
Its acolytes were all once mages, practicing forbidden rituals in the rubble of the [[Craghollows]]. Blood magic, the foulest practice our kind can commit. Who taught them remains a mystery, but through their devotion the Crown is unstoppable._  
_The Crown is different than the others. It compels reverence in those that look upon it. It inspires awe, not fear. It sees us not as victims, but as would-be worshipers. Gravehold is a consummate cage for its subject, therefore there is little reason to destroy it.  
[[Ohat and Ulgimor|Ohat]] says there is no fate worse than death. He is wrong._" ― [[Indira]]
