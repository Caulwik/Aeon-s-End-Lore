#nemesis
The Umbra Titan is a nemesis from [[War Eternal]].

__War Eternal mat lore:__
"_It is a strange thing to say we have never seen The [[Nameless]] die, but we have indeed witnessed one being born._  
_The Umbra Titan speared from the feigned carcass of the [[Thrice-Dead Prophet]] like some foul offspring. As first we thought it merely some grotesque machination, another minion perhaps, but in time it has proven to be a adversary of equal measure. Even the indigenous beasts of the cave seem to worship it._  
_Beneath the skin of the cave it roars, burrowing through rock and darkness like a blind knife through muscle. The ground shakes as a precursor to its attack. It is a horrible thing to see people not know where to seek shelter, instead inert as they wait for the monstrous thing to emerge - if it emerges at all._  
_Of all The Nameless, the Titan is the most feral. [[Xaxos]] thinks them holy, but this is no god or otherwise. It is an animal of the basest instincts: to hunt, to kill, to live._" ― [[Indira]]
