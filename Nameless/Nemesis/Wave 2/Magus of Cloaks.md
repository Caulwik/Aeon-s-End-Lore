#nemesis
The Magus of Cloaks is a nemesis from [[War Eternal]].

War Eternal mat lore:
"_We live in darkness. Darkness and silence. Only when they come does the [[Gravehold|city]] seem truly alive. The torches break the shadows against the cave walls. The bells join our voices as we prepare for yet another onslaught.  
The Magus is a thing of darkness. With every blow, we merely peel away one cloak of shadow to reveal another: Its minions are but splintered shadows, each possessing no mind, no life. In a world as bleak as this, could there be no greater master?_" ― [[Indira]]
