#nemesis 
Wraithmonger is a nemesis from [[The Outer Dark]].

__The Outer Dark mat lore:__
"_Sleep is a luxury not often had in [[Gravehold]]. Dreaming even more so. Thus it is the cruelest of jests that The [[Nameless]] have a creature which holds dominion over both.  
Wraithmonger was not born of the [[Void|void]] like the others. It lurks within our minds, a shapeless horror buried deep within us all. It is only when we dream that it manifests in the world beyond our sleep. It flickers in the dark above the city, eerily beautiful as it drags itself from each dreamer's skull. Its tendrils waft in the still air, leeching terror as it rises to feed.  
They say [[Yan Magda]] sleeps no more, as she spent aeons in the [[Black Mausoleum]]. But the rest of us must. Dare we dream and wake the monster within our heads? Let us dream of nothing._" ― [[Indira]]

__Wave 2 cards lore:__
+ Abyssal Nightmare (Wraithmonger Minion): "_It slides between the world of the waking and that of dreams, a graceful nightmare given form._"
+ Horrify (Wraithmonger Minion): "_The cacophony of their screams filled the [[Dirt Market]], each person falling to their knees in utter horror._"
