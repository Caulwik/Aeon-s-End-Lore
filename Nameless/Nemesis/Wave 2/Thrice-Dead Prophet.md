#nemesis 
Thrice-Dead Prophet is a nemesis from [[The Outer Dark]].

__The Outer Dark mat lore:__
"_It was thought impossible to kill The [[Nameless]], yet we did just that. Or so we thought...  
The first time we slew the Prophet, it seemed all too easy. It shambled out of the void, its massive body clad with the faces of gods we no longer remembered. We were upon it quickly, like a swarm of scarabs upon a carcass. It did not fight back, or so it seemed. And in our haste we thought ourselves the victors.  
The second time we fought the creature, its minions put us to our paces. [[Frayla]], an inexperienced mage, met her end that day, crushed under the enormity of the thing as it fell dead once more. In some death spasm. It took out an entire section of the South Wall, and twenty others with it.  
The third was meant to be the last. [[Sparrow]] lopped of its faceless head, but it mattered not. Without [[Yan Magda]] and the others, [[Gravehold]] would have met its end that day.  
The Prophet lay still as stone for an hour this time. Then, from the stump of its neck, the [[Umbra Titan]] emerged. This beast took nine more mages' lives before [[Ohat and Ulgimor|Ulgimor]] forced it into [[The Depths (location)|The Depths]]. And that was our only victory that day: the accidental creation of [[Ohat and Ulgimor|Ulgimor]]. 
We now know that each victory was merely a feint, a test of our mettle and skill. Let the fourth time the Prophet dies be its last and final Death._" ― [[Indira]]
