#nemesis 
Maiden of Thorns is a nemesis from [[The Void]].

__The Void mat lore:__
"_[[Adelheim]] considers the Maiden with strange admiration. After all, it is a weapon of sorts. And like all weapons, its purpose is simple: to be lethal.  
This is not to say it lacks a mind. In fact, quite the opposite. It revels in cruelty. There is no easy death to be had from this creature or its ilk. Suffering is like air in its lungs, like blood through its vein.
[[Xaxos]] wonders if it feeds upon knowledge. We have witnessed it supping from the skull of fallen mages many times. Poor [[Gadymir]], just barely earning the moniker of mage, was impaled through his helm. And though the wound was superficial, he forgot his name, his training, everything. Now he pulls a cart in the [[Dirt Market]] for [[Ohat and Ulgimor|Ohat]]. 
Is it not enough to take our lives? Must The [[Nameless]] also erase who we are?_" ― [[Indira]]

__Wave 2 lore:__
+ "_The Maiden clambered upon the fallen mage, seeming to devour her throes like nectar._"
