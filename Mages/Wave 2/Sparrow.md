__War Eternal mat lore:__
"_What I'm saying is, we're making it too complicated. Ever since they showed up, it's been bicker and argue, argue and bicker. Why all this talk? We know we need to fight, so let's go fight. No talking needed for that._ 
  
_[[Brama]] says [[Yan Magda|Yan]] and her pack of miscreants are heretics and cannot be trusted, that the help they gave in the battle with the [[Thrice-Dead Prophet]] was just to throw us off. I bet they saw we were winning anyway; we could have done it without them no matter what anybody says. And let us not forget the aftermath of that fight..._  
  
_I have an idea - keep them fighting The [[Nameless]]. They will die in battle, or they'll slip up and betray their true loyalty, in which case I'll kill them myself. Either way we'll be rid of them, and that suits me just fine._" ― Sparrow
