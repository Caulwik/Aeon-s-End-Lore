Garu is a mage from [[War Eternal]] with the title "Oathsworn Protector" and ability "Colossal Force".

War Eternal mat lore:
"_My first day in [[Gravehold]], a child in the hovels asked if I was a monster. Though I laughed, the words cut deep. I see the way they look upon me, with doubt, with horror. In truth, I cannot remember being anything other than this._
  
_I wandered the [[void]], then ended up here. There is no more to my story. My life before is but an echo, a single familiar sound deep in the hollow of my heart. I hear a voice, a child's voice. And under the rasping of my breath, its wordless cries fill me with dread and longing. I can taste the name, but never enough to utter it aloud._
  
_I knelt that day in the hovels, and forced a smile upon my face. 'The world is full of monsters, little one. But not all of them are bad.'_" ― Garu
