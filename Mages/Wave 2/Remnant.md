__The Outer Dark mat lore:__
"_[[Yan Magda]] insists I was once someone else. A man. A woman. Perhaps a child. I had a name and a life that was somehow lost. She explained that I am now but a fragment of my former self, a trick of the light given form and thought. A ghost in a world of those soon to follow. But I have no memory of who or what I was. I know only that I must persist._  
  
_It is always a struggle. Were I to have a body, I would likely describe the agony that is maintaining this form. I would likely fall to the cold ground and fill the world with screams as I begin to unravel. But I feel nothing because I am nothing. There is no pain, only the urge to linger a little longer. I cannot depart, not yet._  
  
_So I sharpen what I think are my thoughts and force my way back into the world, to this dire place full of battered souls. I am needed here, whatever I may be, wherever this may be. My task remains unfulfilled. I must persist._" ― Remnant
