__War Eternal mat lore:__
"_I still remember the day The [[Conclave]] sentenced me to sleep. You see, they did not believe in killing, as necessary a thing as it may seem to all other creatures and creeds. My crime, among others, was in questioning the nature of their ways. And thus the punishment was to entomb my mind in the gulag of my still body for eternity. They called this the '[[Black Mausoleum]].'_  
  
_And so it was that I lay in the hollow of my sarcophagus, drawing what then I thought was the last conscious breath of my very long life. The light died all around me and with it I went, trapped in the amber of dreams._  
  
_I cannot recall my time in the sepulcher of sleep. Just blackness and quiet unending. But there came a day when the light spilled across my face and I gasped as a brutish man yanked me from my coma. All around us were tendrils of strange light spiraling into infinity, each one flecked with what seemed a world in miniature. I still remember plucking one of those delicate lights from the nothing, unaware I had snuffed out an entire world._  
  
_In time our cadre of orphans grew in number and in strangeness. We lost many companions along the way, each erased like that tiny light in the spiral. Their faith gave me then strength to journey forward, though in my heart it was retribution that urged me on._  
  
_There was a day when the spiral seemed to fall away and a sudden cold was upon us. [[Garu]]'s labored breath reverberated the dirt crunching under foot. And this was the first time I knew I was truly awake. This was the day we met [[Indira]] and learned the truth of it. And once again, I found myself entombed in the black quiet of another world._" ― Yan Magda
