#mage 
Indira is a playable mage from [[The Outer Dark]] with the title "Breach Apprentice" and ability "Pyromancer's Guile".

__The Outer Dark mat lore:__
"_[[Malastar]] was kind at least. He took my hand and made me sit before he gently explained [[Brama]]'s decision. It was a matter of the proper form, he said. I had not completed the entire [[apprentice's ordeal]]. I had not returned to [[Gravehold]] alone. Were I to be allowed to call myself a mage without completing the ordeal, other younglings might press for other exceptions. 'We cannot have any weakening of the customs of the mages, for the mages are too important to our survival,' he told me._  
  
_But no, it would erode the faith of those around me to have to work with me, Brama said, and so it was for the best that I take my gem and my years of study and all the spells I had learned and go become a dirt merchant or sentry upon the balustrade._  
  
_That is what Brama said. But the truth is, it wasn't for the lack of completing the ordeal. It was because she no longer trusted me. More precisely, she did not trust me upon returning in the company of [[Yan Magda]]. _ 
  
_So now, in a great irony, I study with [[Yan Magda]]. I listen to her tales, her time spent in between worlds. She speaks truths others dare not utter, and for this alone she was branded a heretic. And through her words I hone my skills._  
  
_How tragic that both women reach for the same goals, and yet cannot reach together._" ― Indira
