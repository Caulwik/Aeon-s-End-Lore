__War Eternal mat lore:__
"_I was born in the place between worlds. [[Yan Magda]] held me as I drew my very first breath and my true mother took her last. I still remember this, as though it only just happened. From that moment forth, I was her student._
  
_Time in the [[Void|void]] is not as it is elsewhere. It moves too quickly, and sometimes not at all. My years are not what they seem. I am not as I seem. I remember being born, and, somehow, what it feels like to die. Like The [[Nameless]], I live in the place in between._
  
_[[Brama]] and her sycophants, let them have [[Gravehold]]. Let them cower here in the dark. There will come a time when the void will swallow all. And I stare in to the infinite with warm tears in my eyes, knowing in some strange way I am home._" ― Dezmodia
