__War Eternal mat lore:__
"_I am a coward and cowards are not meant to fight wars. As cowards are wont to do, I ran when I saw the [[Umbra Titan]] heave from the feigned corpse of the [[Thrice-Dead Prophet|Prophet]], pushing fellow dirt merchants and even a child so that I might save my own life. When the Titan's shadow loomed over me, everything changed in an instant._
  
_'Ulgimor.' This is the only word it says, not that anyone else can hear it. Thus I have taken to calling the creature this name, as have others. It is everything I am not, yet the breach mages insist it is, by extension, some part of me. They have taught it their ways, giving me some lump of enchanted coal to try and control the thing. As it frenzies in battle, I cower behind the shield [[Adelheim]] forged, waiting for it all to end._  
  
_But Ulgimor would never let this happen, for without me no shadow would be cast. I take what little comfort I can in this notion, though we both know the life of a coward suits me better than that of a hero._" ― Ohat
