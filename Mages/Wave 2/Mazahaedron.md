Mazahaedron is a playable mage from [[War Eternal]] with the title "Henge Mystic" and ability "Underearth Mantra".

__War Eternal mat lore:__
"_If one listens, this cave speaks an ancient tongue. We are reminded that the world is a living, breathing thing. A sacred beast in which we thrive. Here, under its skin, inside its very heart, most remain unknowing, and fewer still grateful to behold such a thing. 'Worlds within worlds,' as the henge mystics say. 'Lights within lights.'_
  
_I marvel at the wonder that surrounds me, the life that burgeons in spite of our bleak ordeal. There is a wisdom in every stone, a truth in every shadow. The echoes of our own voices are but a mirror. And for this very reason, I have never, nor will ever, let my feet touch the hallowed earth below._  
  
_And though my brothers fade in the grim quiet above, their wisdom remains my compass. Open your eyes, I say. Listen. The [[Nameless]] are but weak fevers to this world, and like all sickness, they will pass._" ― Mazahaedron
