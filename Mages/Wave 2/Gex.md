#mage 
Gex is a mage from [[War Eternal]] with the title "Breach Mage Advisor" and ability "Vimcraft Oath".

War Eternal mat lore:
"_A hammer is the perfect weapon for our fight, because it doesn't have to be a weapon. Swords must be swords, spears must be spears, and bows must shoot arrows. But a hammer can be a tool, can build as well as destroy. A hammer helps us remember we have something to protect, something beyond our fight._
  
_[[Brama]] and I have had many long discussions about how appearances matter, and how they don't, and how to look inside them to the truth. I remind her of my training, when I chose my gem. Even she looked at me askance when I returned with a plain grey rock. Until I showed her the spell to look beyond the surface to the beautiful geode within._
  
_Hidden power, hidden reasons, these suit our purposes best. Especially now, when we are surrounded by so many others with hidden thoughts. Neither I nor Brama can fully divine the mind of [[Yan Magda]], nor the mind of the being we once called [[Mist]]. Both claim to be allies. Both have helped in the fight so far, that much must be admitted. Nevertheless, I will keep my greatest reasons, and my greatest powers, in reserve. Just in case._" ― Gex
