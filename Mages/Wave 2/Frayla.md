__[[Thrice-Dead Prophet]] mat lore:__
"_\[...\]
The second time we fought the creature, its minions put us to our paces. Frayla, an inexperienced mage, met her end that day, crushed under the enormity of the thing as it fell dead once more. In some death spasm. It took out an entire section of the South Wall, and twenty others with it.
