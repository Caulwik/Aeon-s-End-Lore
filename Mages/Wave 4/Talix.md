__The New Age mat lore:__
"_It was kind of lonely growing up in [[Southern Outpost]]. There weren't many kids my age to play with so I made my own fun by exploring the wilds. It was against the rules to go out alone, but that was what made it so fun. As the top dog of Southpost, my mom had more important things to do than keep a super close eye on me. So I spent a lot of time at home. Studying. Right next to a conveniently unlocked window. I knew it was stupid to wander around alone, but I was a kid. Kids are stupid. And I was still an idiot well into my adulthood. I never saw the point of growing up until I had a kid of my own. I found him, [[Inco]], in some ancient ruins, curled up for warmth and half buried in vines that I later learned were part of him. I'm still amazed by how much power he holds in that tiny body of his. I suppose he'd have to be strong, growing up out in the wilds. It's crazy, I was the first other human he ever met in his whole life. It took a while to get him to trust me, but finally I convinced him to come back to [[Southern Outpost]] with me. After a few months we moved to [[New Gravehold]] together so [[Inco]] could be around kids his own age. I know what it's like to feel alone, isolated from your people. As long as I'm here, [[Inco]] will never feel that way._" ― Talix
