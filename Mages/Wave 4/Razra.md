#mage
Mazra is a playable mage from [[Into The Wild]] with the title "The Trainer" and ability "Train [[Rip]]".

__Into The Wild mat lore:__
"_Razra and I may be identical but we couldn't be more different. She's always taken the fact that we live in a jungle full of deadly monsters as more of a challenge than something to fear. She was the sort of child who would break her leg jumping off the roof, and before it even healed, jump off again because now she's sure she's perfected the landing. I think these days the dirt might be so deeply ingrained in her skin that it won't ever come off. It's no wonder she's so close with that strange forest boy, [[Inco]]. I'll admit, I worried about her for a long time. We had both always wanted to become breach mages. While it came naturally to me, Razra struggled. She wouldn't focus on a book, couldn't sit through a lesson. Then, as if it was sent for her, that strange creature wandered close to the city. No normal person would even care, but my sister has never been normal. She threw herself into befriending this creature, named it [[Rip]], and trained it beyond what anyone had assumed possible. It was miraculous. With [[Rip]] by her side Razra grew quickly in strength, racing through her training at unprecedented speeds. Finally, she joined me as a full fledged breach mage. I was starting to get bored waiting for her to catch up._" ― [[Mazra]]

Razra is the narrator of the wave 4 mat lore of [[Mazra]].
