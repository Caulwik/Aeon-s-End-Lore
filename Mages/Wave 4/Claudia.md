Claudia is a playable mage from [[The New Age]] with the title "Prospector" and ability "Aeplosion".

__The New Age mat lore:__
"_I was born with the mind of an artist and the spirit of an inventor. Or maybe the mind of a genius and the spirit of an even better genius! Not to brag, but I was only three years old when I shattered my first [[Gems|gem]]. All planned, of course. I wandered into my [[Kadir|mom]]'s workshop and banged into the leg of her work table. [[Malastar|Dad]] made a fancy new lock for the door after that, probably to try and test my ingenuity. My [[Malastar|dad]]'s really smart like that. Must be where I get it from. Well, I solved his lock puzzle, I wiggled aether around inside until I cracked it. [[Malastar|Dad]] kept making harder locks and I kept figuring them out, getting into [[Kadir|mom]]'s lab, and breaking things! I really owe it all to my parents. If they hadn't kept trying to stop me from getting places, I never would have gotten anywhere. Just like refining a diamond. My parents taught me to always seek to learn and to grow and evolve! Right now, we are standing on the shoulders of our foremothers and they are saying we're heavy and need to get off and walk on our own two feet! Everyone is so limited in imagination, our exploration of aether is held back only by our unwillingness to seek it out. We all know that aether is in [[Gems]], but it's also in EVERYTHING. This world IS aether! I am aether! Some people say I'm crazy, but I say this WORLD is crazy! It's time to start fighting fire with fire. Since I can feel my own aether, and everybody else's aether, I can control it with a level of detail no one has ever dreamed of before! So yeah, I'm a genius. My [[Kadir|mom]] might be pretty proud of her emerald, but I'm the best gem she ever created._" ― Claudia
