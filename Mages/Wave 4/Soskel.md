Soskel is a playable mage from [[The New Age]] with the title "Aristocrat" and ability "Energized Sigil".

__The New Age mat lore:__
"_It wasn't until [[Arachnos]] captured me and forced [[Void]] essence into my very soul that I understood what true power is. It's the potential to make a difference, to save those you love. My whole life I've only wanted to serve and protect [[Gravehold]] but I was never strong enough. It's my home, and its people are my family. As a youth, I carried crying children as we ran from [[The Fall]], told them stories to help them sleep as we wandered the tunnels. I was a nobody, but I wanted to be useful. I had to defend what was left. After that day, I vowed to never again be so helpless. I needed to understand breach magic, but [[Mist]] said it was uncommon for an adult to become a mage initiate. I watched the children I had saved surpass me, become prodigious mages and burn brighter than I ever imagined. When [[Brama]] selected me as commander of an expedition to the north, I was shocked. My breach magic was certainly competent, but I was nowhere near as powerful as the mages she put under my leadership. I asked her why she chose me and [[Brama]] smiled. She said that while power is important, the true mark of a leader is understanding those he leads. It was this discipline, and my familiarity with loss, that let me survive the torture of [[Arachnos]]' ritual without forgetting myself. I have watched friends die too many times. This power may be corrupted, but if I can use it to help, I won't hold back._" ― Soskel
