Mazra is a playable mage from [[The Ancients]] with the title "The Reader" and ability "Research". Mazra has a special breach called "Research Breach".

__The Ancients mat lore:__
"_She'll probably deny it if you ask her, but I think Mazra might love books more than she loves me. She was born like two hours after me and she must have spent the entirety of that time in the womb growing her crazy huge brain. I'm no idiot, but Mazra was six when she gave [[Brama]] a ten-page petition to gain access to the [[Gravehold]] archives room. At just eight years old, she translated an ancient tome of breach magic and memorized spells no one had ever heard of. She was ten when she passed her [[apprentice's ordeal|ordeal]] and became the youngest breach mage ever. When I asked for toys she asked for textbooks. She used to follow [[Brama]] around and sneak into council meetings the way normal kids sneak out of school. We were only five years old when Mazra told me she was gonna be the next head of the [[council of elders]]. If it was any other kid I'd call them ridiculous, but if there's anyone who I trust to run [[Gravehold]], it's my freak of a little sister._" ― [[Razra]]
