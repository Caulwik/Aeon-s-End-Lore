__The New Age mat lore:__
"_[[Gravehold|Old Gravehold]] and its unknown troves of power aren't lost. Nothing is lost until we stop looking for it. There are little cracks and pockets full of knowledge and treasure all over this world, and I'm the one who's gonna hunt them down. Years and years of rain filled up the tunnels we abandoned in [[The Fall]], drowning ancient ruins and their manifold mysteries. Somewhere down there lie the sunken secrets forgotten by the modern children of [[New Gravehold]], just waiting for me to rediscover them. The elders balked when I proposed an exploratory mission into the depths, shying away from adventure in favor of the known. For them, [[Gravehold|Old Gravehold]] is nothing but a memory of failure and loss. But I won't let emotion steer me away from discovery! I recruited [[Kadir]] to help me craft a spell for holding air, and her daughter [[Claudia]] insisted on joining my expedition below the surface. [[Claudia]]'s focus may be scattered but her mind is keen and sharp. I needed her help maintaining her mother's spell to reach the deepest ruins. While swimming among the sunken stones, we found a strange necklace inside an unnatural pocket of air. We returned to the surface with it and I discovered it had the power to bend water to my will. More marvels just like it must be waiting below. Who knows what mysteries I - we - have yet to uncover. Our hunt for the unknown has only just begun._" ― Gygar
