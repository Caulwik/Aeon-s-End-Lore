__Shattered Dreams mat lore:__
"_Give me a second to clear my thoughts. It gets harder and harder to tell this story in the proper order. Finally, when I ran out of breaches, the portal began pulling at me, pulling at my very mind. I wanted to see the other side. The more we could learn about the [[Void]], I was sure, the better we could defend ourselves. After that, [[Indira]] trapped my little [[Void]] in a magical containment sphere. I thought I could create a simulation, a miniaturized Void breach, the kind the [[Nameless]] came through. The worst of them all was that the portal required energy, too much energy. I used to have a mind unparalleled in all of [[New Gravehold]]. [[Indira]] kept me together, afterwards. I opened breach after breach and the [[Void]] kept sucking them in, devouring their energy. If we could manufacture a Void portal, I believed I could peer through safely. At least I can use the sphere, now. I was a scientist. I would have died if [[Indira]] hadn't come in and stopped it. But it's not what I was before. I like to think I still am one, despite everything that I lost. To this day I do not know if I succeeded. I awoke without familiar breach magic, without many of my memories, without my mind. Initially, my research encountered many issues. [[Indira]] understands what it's like to have all of your energy concentrated in one place. More energy than I could muster. Time was scattered, messy, hard to grasp. I'll never be that again. Give me a second to clear my thoughts. It gets harder and harder to tell this story in the proper order._"
