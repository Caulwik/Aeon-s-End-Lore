#mage
Lost is a playable mage from [[The New Age]] with the title "Living Forge" and ability "Meek's Might".

__The New Age mat lore:__
"_After we defeated that massive [[Fenrix|wolf-like Nameless]], we found this suit of armor hiding below ground. Lost managed to remember that he was a mage of [[Gravehold]], but we don't know which mage, nor how he found himself bound to this suit of armor. During [[The Fall]], the tunnels collapsed, which sealed off outposts and scouting parties. We never learned the fate of many breach mages during that time. Already some people treat Lost like a ghost returned from our unhappy past. Some, myself included, can't help but see him as a sign that all our missing friends might still be out there. I know it's foolish to get caught up in baseless hopes, but I still want to believe we could find just one more mage. After all, who knows how long Lost has been down there, waiting patiently for someone to come. Not knowing who he is, forging weapons he didn't know how to use. But I am hopeful. Each day, Lost's connection to us all grows stronger. Perhaps we may one day be able to reunite him with loved ones._" ― [[Soskel]]
