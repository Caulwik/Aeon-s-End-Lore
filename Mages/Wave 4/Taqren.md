__The New Age mat lore:__
"_Danger unifies. Tragedy hardens. Desperation brings out the deepest strength in a person's soul. This is why the people of [[Gravehold]] cling like cockroaches to the surface of this world that hates us. I was a child when my mother, [[Z'hana]], pulled me sobbing out of the collapsing tunnels. My father was in too deep, fighting to protect us against Maelstrom. I watched, helpless, as he vanished behind the rocks. I will always remember listening to my mother, the strongest person I know, crying herself to sleep. The next morning she sat me down and brushed the hair from my eyes. She said, "I want to see you grow up in peace, my child, but our world does not know peace. I wish you could grow up feeling safe, but this city is not safe. Your father and I have tried to give you a better future, but we failed. I'm sorry, my love. All I can give you now is the strength to keep fighting. Succeed where we could not. Make this world a place where your children do not need to struggle to survive. Become strong, but do not become a weapon. Become their shield."_" ― Taqren
