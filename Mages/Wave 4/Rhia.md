Rhia is a playable mage from [[The New Age]] with the title "Relic Hunter" and ability "Sublimate".

__The New Age mat lore:__
"_When I was a kid I started losing my hair. No one knew what was happening, not even [[Brama]]. I was weak, bedridden for months. My folks figured I was gonna die, they cried over me while I drifted in and outta consciousness. They talked like I was already gone, sayin' how I'd be at peace now and all. Screw that. I've never been at peace my whole life. This whole world has never been at peace. Life is a battle and I'm not the givin' up type. Don't ask me how I found the strength but one night I got outta bed and stumbled into my dad's laboratory. I grabbed hold of one of the artifacts he'd been researching and poured every scrap of magical energy I had into it. I felt my skin changing and a tingle on my scalp. My hair began to grow back, strange and crystalline. Somehow, that infusion of breach magic fixed me. [[Brama]] has never stopped trying to find the secret to my healing. No one knows why I got sick or how I got better, or where my new hair comes from, but I don't care. Every day I walk on my own two feet is a day I stole from the [[Void]]. And I'm not done fighting yet._" ― Rhia
