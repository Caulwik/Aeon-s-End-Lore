Sahala is a playable mage from [[The New Age]] with the title "Oracle" and ability "Star Bind". Sahala has a special breach called "Celestial Breach".

__The New Age mat lore:__
"_I grew up on my father's stories of how [[Xaxos]] saved his life. My father would stretch his arms out wide, growling like a fanger stalker, and then grand my hand and pull me down low, pretending to cower in fear. He'd whisper dramatically about how far he was from [[Gravehold]], all alone, with absolutely no hope of rescue. I would laugh, pull on his sleeve, jump up and down. You're not alone, Dad, look around the corner, [[Xaxos]] followed you. In my father's stories, [[Xaxos]] was always there, blasting his way through hordes of comical enemies. In real he was always around, practicing breach magic with my father, helping me with my own studies. I once asked [[Xaxos]] about the story, about how it actually went. He just knelt beside me and pointed at where my father was practicing, working the many facets of a shimmering stone. "We retrieved that fallen star, Sahala. That is what is important. Power is often hidden in the cruelest of places. But that does not mean we have to be cruel to find it". When Xaxos turned on the other mages, it broke my father's heart. He couldn't bring himself to choose between duty and love. So he chose neither and stepped down from his duties as a breach mage. I took the opposite path. If my father had opposed [[Xaxos]], there was no guarantee he could have swayed his decision, but by doing nothing he made no difference at all. My father abandoned his friend by not taking that chance. [[Gravehold]] abandoned [[Xaxos]]'s student when we cast them out. I will not abandon my brothers. I found the meteorite my father and [[Xaxos]] had recovered all those years ago collecting dust in our cellar. I use its power now, and I will fight where my father did not dare. I cannot believe that the [[Xaxos]] I knew is gone. He cannot be beyond saving._" ― Sahala
