Qu is a playable mage from [[The Ancients]] with the title "Builder and Destroyer" and ability "Duality Embrace".

__The Ancients mat lore:__
"_Even though he was my father, I never really knew [[Xaxos]]. Not like some of his old friends here in [[Gravehold]]. Growing up, I could tell I was looking at the shell of a man. I was seeing someone desperately trying to piece himself back together, to regain something lost, to return to the man he was before. I never met the man my father was. The [[Void]] changes people. I should know, I lived my whole life there. I wonder, now, if the [[Nameless]] fight and kill because the very essence of their world drives them to it. Bloodlust permeates the air, twisting their minds. Or perhaps it is the emptiness, the barren nothing they are born into forces them into action. Growing up here, I understand what drives them towards the portals. The first time I saw a breach open I dropped everything. I didn't stop to think about my father, his research, our home, or my things. Everything paled in comparison to the potential to escape. I doubt he will ever even notice I am gone. Time is warped, it passes differently inside the [[Void]]. I don't know how old I am, or how long I have been gone, or where my place is in this strange world. But I know [[New Gravehold]] is beautiful. Humans are beautiful. Perhaps it is because of my humanity that I can control the [[Void]] energy that has consumed my entire life. I've embraced my rage, channeled my hurt, and funneled my passion outward into strength. I will not let the [[Nameless]] have this world too, not when I have only just found it._"
