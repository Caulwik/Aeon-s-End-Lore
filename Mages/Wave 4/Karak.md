Karak is a follower of Xaxos that was later transformed into the [[Ageless Walker]] during a experiment from [[Arachnos]].

__Ageless Walker mat lore:__
"_Humans are not meant to mix with the magic of the [[Void]]. The followers of [[Xaxos]] play with powers beyond anyone's comprehension. The [[Ageless Walker]] was once a man named Karak, a devoted follower of [[Xaxos]]. He was a close friend of [[Arachnos]], and submitted willingly to the ritual. He wanted to be infused with the strength of the Nameless, to gain their power. When the [[Void]] energy flowed into him, however, instead of making him stronger it began to waste away at his life. [[Arachnos]] heard the screaming, but refused to stop the ritual. He believe in his calculations above all else, assured of his own undeniable talent. The more Karak absorbed, the more he aged until nothing but bones were left. But the ritual did not stop with his death. He warped beyond that, becoming strange and monstrous, decaying and growing all at once. When the ritual finally concluded, Karak was gone, replaced by a creature that could only be described as a [[Nameless]]. [[Arachnos]] and the other followers were forced to flee from the monster they had created. Now the [[Ageless Walker]] seems to have no memory of being human. It kills indiscriminately, bringing death and decay wherever it walks._"
