__Into The Wild mat lore:__
"_The [[council of elders|elders of Gravehold]] don't know what I am. I understand. For a long time I didn't know what I was either. My roots were planted deep in the wilds, nurtured by strange creatures with emerald eyes and thorny faces. I never considered it odd that my leaves were pinkish flesh instead of sturdy horns and hooves. I never thought about how I control the vines that interlace my body, or where they grew from. It was many years before my branches longed to stretch towards new suns, before my world of green and growth grew tiresome and repetitive. All trees need room to grow, but unlike most plants, I was not rooted. I was free to move and wander. For days I drifted, a lone leaf on the wind, seeking solace from tormenting storms. I took shelter in strange ruins and woke up face to face with a fleshy creature that looked just like me. It took many dawns for us to learn to communicate. Eventually I discovered he was something called a human named [[Talix]]. He took me home with him to [[Gravehold]] and treated me like his own child. There are so many of these humans, like twisting roses, all different hues, each more strange and beautiful than the last, but one here outshines them all. I lean always toward my radiant new sun, [[Razra]]. She and [[Talix]] and this forest of stone are strange beyond comprehension. I am still a stranger here. But I'm not afraid, because these are my people. As my new father told me: 'You're human, Inco. You're home.'_"
