#mage 
Malastar is a mage from the [[The Nameless]].

__The Nameless mat lore:__
"_You can always tell which younglings will be mages. Mostly, they are girls, but sometimes a boy-child will carry the spark, though weaker than their sister-kind. Training each of them is my sad calling, for mages come and go like the black days in this place._  

_First, they learn the sister-words, the mage's tongue, the language of all things. Next we fashion them a gem, one that is theirs alone, a conduit for their nascent power. After this, [[Kadir]] takes them deep within the bowels of the cave, where they must find their way back with only their gem to protect them. Many find their way home, but we have lost many would-be mages in my years._  
  
_A student's last task is to slay a beast, armed again only with their gem and their wits. The child is dropped down a shaft outside [[Chasmwalk]], left alone with whatever miscreation we have snared from the [[void]]. Sometimes the creature is wounded, weak, but always they are hungry. A student that navigates this ordeal is named apprentice. After that, one need only survive long enough to earn the rank of mage._" ― Malastar
