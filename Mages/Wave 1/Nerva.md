__ [[Core set]] rules lore:__
"_This isn't the end of the world. That already happened. This is what's left. Us,_ [[Gravehold]]_, and_ [[Nameless|The Nameless]] _- creatures seeking to snatch what little we have left from our group. The breath in our lungs. The weak light in our eyes. For generations we have taken refuge in an ancient and haunted place, one whose first purpose was forgotten for a thousand ages, until our exodus once again filled its empty halls and hovels with our shadows. Here in the darkness, we seek a way back to the light.  
It has taken the breach mages an aeon to hone their dark craft, but they are ready, they are lethal. The breaches, the very conduits through which The Nameless travel, have become our weapon. The breach mages wield this power with undeniable ambition: to survive, to take back_ [[The World That Was]]_, to protect our home._" ― Nerva, Gravehold survivor
