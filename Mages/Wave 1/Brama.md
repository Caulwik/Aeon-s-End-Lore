Brama is a mage from the [[Core set]].

__Core set mat lore:__
"_My conclave of sisters is long ago gone, all of them ash in the world above. I do not remember their names, only their faces and the brightness in their eyes. Their songs fade in the grey shadows of my many years, and I alone can still hear them. Only [[Gravehold]] is more ancient than I. Yet somehow I endure.  
  
_This city looks to me for guidance, for I have walking a long, wearisome path to stand before them. This is my duty, my burden, my privilege. It was I who counseled them to collapse the [[Cave Mouth|mouth of the cave]], to entomb us here. It was I who taught the mages to wield the [[sister-words]]. Where so many have slipped beneath the shadow, I have remained in light.  
  
_Many say we are lost, that [[Gravehold]] is just that: our grave. They say that, like my sisters, we will be erased, our bones left to molder in the silence of this cave. But glory will be ours again and I will live to feel the sun and wind on my face once more. Faith, younglings. It is our best weapon._" ― Brama

__[[Legacy]] rules lore:__
_"You are not breach mages yet," Brama lectures as she paces down the line of her students, her frail form belying her immense power. "Breach mages have protected us since the beginning ― since the burning of the world and our pilgrimage into the dark. It was they who founded [[Gravehold]], our last bastion, and if you wish to stand beside these living legends, you must listen and learn. The [[Nameless]] shall come again, as the always have, and you will need to be ready. You are the hope of our future"
\[...\]
"Each of you must overcome your [[apprentice's ordeal|ordeal]] to learn discipline and focus, the tools you will need to defend [[Gravehold]]. We are nothing without [[Gravehold]]. To be a breach mage is to sacrifice your life to [[Gravehold]]. When you die, it will be in defense of our city. Once you understand this universal truth...only then will you be ready to become a mage"_

__The New Age Prologue Lore:__
"_In the aftermath of [[the Fall]], nothing was left except destruction and despair. When [[Gravehold]] Past was buried, our world collapsed, but a spark of perseverance remains even now. The spirit of [[Gravehold]] is her people, and we shall survive on this strange verdant surface. More than survive, [[New Gravehold]] will thrive._" ― The Tale of [[the Fall]], Master Brama, Elder Breach Teacher
