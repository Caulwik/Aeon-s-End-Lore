__Core set mat lore:__
"<i>The others, they do not understand. For them, struggle is a virtue acknowledged by less cruel gods than these. They ignore the dark around them and seek a world whose name they cannot remember. But I have discerned our road to salvation, fractured and perilous, straight through the heart of the </i>[[Void]]<i>.  
  
We may learn much from these creatures, these divinities, though dark they may be. Theirs is a power to cull worlds, to tear wide the membrane of the universe, to traverse the very emptiness that lay between. Is it not within reason to presume they may also have some means to shape worlds as well as destroy them? Perhaps they can whisper into existence more than their fell armies and beasts. The tools they wield are just that - tools. Who is to say we cannot use a tool for a better end?  
  
Yet these words alone are enough to brand me a mage heretic. It is for this reason I stifle them, though these thoughts echo behind my silence in a way that seems wisdom. For now, I will study our foes closely, and in doing so I shall learn how to lift us from this torment... no matter what means I must use.</i>" ― Xaxos

__The Void mat lore:__
"_There are others now. Others like me. Others that believe there is a wisdom to be had in our supposed enemies. [[Yan Magda]] only reinforces this theory, as she walked between worlds with her gaggle of oddities for aeons. The void may yet be our salvation, our ascension. But we must be caution, lest we face the gallows. As we have seen since Yan's arrival, [[Brama]] is a suspicious soul._  
  
_Thus we meet in the ruins of the [[Craghollows]], clandestine and clad in robes. Behind masks, we practice our blood magic and peer into the fractured barrier between our world and theirs. The dead air that spills from the breach carries whispers. And in time, those whispers have told us what must be done._

_Were the others to hear these whispers, they would say the end is near. And they would be right. The end is fast approaching. But not ours. Our time is just beginning._" ― Xaxos
