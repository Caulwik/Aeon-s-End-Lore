#mage 
Nym is a mage from [[The Depths]].

__The Depths mat lore:__
"The [[Nameless]]... what a stupid name for these things. It makes no sense. It's just frightened people trying to understand something they don't. Monsters. That's what these things are. Nothing more, nothing less.  
  
[[Malastar]] says respecting one's foe is the straightest and clearest path to defeating them. But why would I respect monsters? Malastar is wrong. Respect is a useless concept in this fight - I have no respect for those freaks and I have turned as many of them to cinder as anyone.  
  
A lot of people are afraid of "The Nameless," but not me. They think I am too young to know what fear is, but really, fear is the only thing we younglings know. But I choose not to fear them any more. I won't give them anything other than my fire." ― Nym
