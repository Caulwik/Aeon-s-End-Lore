#mage 
Reeve is a mage from [[The Depths]].

__The Depths mat lore:__
"I lost the arm to tainted jade. I felt it creeping through my arteries and lopped it off without a thought. Best to lose the arm and keep the rest, no?  
  
[[Kadir]] says I was born for this, meant to live here and now in this damnable hole in the ground to fight these things. And she has the right of it. This is who I am, what I am: a blunt instrument to be used against monsters. My life matters not for much more than that. And I am at peace with it.  
  
Whenever those bells ring I feel my heart swell as I heave my chopper from its sheath. I smell the air burn as the breach opens and I cannot run there fast enough. We all have a purpose, a gift to give. This is mine." ― Reeve
