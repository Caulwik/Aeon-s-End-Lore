Lash is a mage from the [[Core set]].

_Core set mat lore:_
"_Like the jagged rocks around us, these are hard times. You can see it reflected in the eyes of even the heartiest folk: the fog of constant dread looming large within them._  
  
_But me, I laugh, I smile. For any day is worth living well, no? What other use would it be? We are the lucky ones, though our journey may be paved with strife. I laugh anyway. Smile anyway. Let my voice be heard ringing against the wall of the cave, echoing into nothing. If today be my last, then let it also be my best._  
  
_Often I stare down at the city from the balustrade, the [[Dirt Market]] being my favorite place to contemplate. The good people there, peddling their wares, the cacophony of their haggling, the scent of salted meat and brine. And I think to myself, "The world does go on." And so it does, in spite of our trials, our great adversity. The people in the market, they still find it within themselves to sit at their stall and hope for a good day's profit. To savor the banter of a spirited haggle. To cook a simple yet tasty meal to share with loved ones. And at night in their hovels, they dream against the dark. There is no beauty in this world or any other greater than that._" ― Lash
