#mage 
Z'hana is a mage from [[The Depths]].

The Depths mat lore:
"Through the flames I could hear them calling for me. My mother, my father. Their voices drowned in fire and smoke... That was the day I lost my family. That was the day I discovered I was a mage.  
  
My philosophies on The Nameless are even less popular than [[Xaxos]]'. Many times I have slept in the [[Crypts]] for things I have said to others. But many more nights I have fought back the dark, side by side with those who locked the crypt door behind me.  
  
I have journeyed to the [[Cave Mouth]] many times, sitting in the weak light that somehow manages to penetrate the mountain of rubble that bars out way back to [[The World That Was]]. Each time I go, I remove a stone. If they catch me, the [[crypts]] await. But I always go back, removing another stone and yet another. One day I will seek whatever awaits me beyond this place. One day I will remove the last stone." ― Z'hana
