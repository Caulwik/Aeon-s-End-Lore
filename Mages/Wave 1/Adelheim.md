Adelheim is a mage from the [[Core set]].

__Core set mat lore:__
"<i>It is folly what I do, to make things in a place where everything is broken. But still, I bring my hammer down. We all have work to do and I'll not let pride keep me from it.  
  
Ours is an army of fools, yes. We make weapons of the very breaches they wander through. No mystery we die so, when we try to play with deadliest powers we know. But what of it truly? This is still the way of the things, in spite of all that has passed: some people die while the rest must fight. So I bring my hammer down, again and again. Mending swords. Fashioning strangeness from breach-touched ore. They ask it of me and thus it is done, for folly or not.</i>" ― Adelheim
