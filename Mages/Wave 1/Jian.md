#mage
Jian is a mage from the [[Core set]].

__Core set mat lore:__
"_Father died. The orb. I took it in my hands. And then quiet was upon me._  
  
_Orphan. Then the mages. I learned the sister-words. The spark. But never spoke them.  _
  
_Like [[Phaedraxa]], I see. It changed me.  _
  
_There are many worlds. The [[Nameless]] are a scourge to all. So, war.  _
  
_Once, I was born. Soon, I will save them, then become nothing. Everything in between is just waiting._
  
_A web. It's all a web.__" ― Jian

__Wave 1 cards:__
+ Moonstone Shard (Gem): Like many children of [[Gravehold]], Jian was left an orphan, stricken silent by the very thing that took her father's light.
+ Focusing Orb (Relic): Jian picked up the orb as if knowing its purpose. That was the last day she ever spoke.
