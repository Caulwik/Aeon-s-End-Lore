Phaedraxa is a mage from the [[Core set]].

Core set mat lore:
"<i>Time is a web, like the ones the howling spinners weave in the deeps. Each strand reaches backwards and forward at once. What was, what is, what will be, there is no difference in the web. Silk is silk. Time is time.  
  
I spoke the sister-words before they were taught to me, before I could walk, but after the world was gone. </i>[[Brama]]<i> says that is because the wraiths of the sisters encircle me beyond the veil, but she understands not. There is no host of sister-ghosts guiding my path. There is no chorus of voices within me, only my own. I merely see the web and all trapped in it.  
  
I look at the survivors of this city, this beautiful and stark place hidden in the deep shadows. And in the web, I behold </i>[[Gravehold]]<i>, as it was and as it will be. I peel aside the door of a breach. And in the web, a breach widens, much like an eye struggling against the dark. I am born and I die. The Nameless are much the same.  
  
This is a web, no different, no more.</i>" ― Phaedraxa
