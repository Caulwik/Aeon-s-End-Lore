__Core set mat lore:__
"<i>The mages, they all think me brave, their closest substitute to </i>[[Thraxir]]<i>. His death was like all the others: swift and cruel. It is true, I have waded in the fire of the breach three times. Each time I have left splinters of myself behind, little shreds ripped from my bleeding soul. Though many beasts have been quieted by my blade, I must confess each one of them has scared me more than the last.  
  
I am not brave. Not like Thraxir, not like </i>[[Brama]]<i>. I simply do this because it was asked of me. I fight not truly for </i>[[Gravehold]]<i> alone, but selfishly - I would risk everything for the hope of leaving this place. I was made a dagger captain and taught the sister-words to wield the breach, but I am no difference than any one here: scared, desperate, and willing to die for an opportunity to once again be alive.</i>" ― Mist

__War Eternal mat lore:__
"_I am the vessel now. I -the 'I' I was, at least - entered the breach, as I had done thrice before, as in my absurd and youthful eagerness to slay these creatures, I even desired to fight them where they lived. As if the beasts we fight would be intimidated to fight in the [[Void|void]]._
  
_Child that I was, fortune was with me, as I was victorious. But as I turned to leave the breach, a much greater fortune awaited. I remember I was just about to step through, when I heard a sound. A humming, a ringing, yet more musical, as if a thousand crystal insects sang a chorus. In an instant, the sound surrounded my. In a second instant, the sound entered me._
  
_The events that happened to the 'me' that was, those seem to me now at a remove. Old hurts, childhood loves, battle fears - my memories of the time before the change are but memories of memories now, as if I remember a vivid story told to me rather than events in my own life._
  
_But, oh, even so, I remember how much the sound hurt. It ate and burned, fire and acid. The sound grabbed my body and convulsed it from the inside, every mote of my being individually seized and shaken. If I had had any control over my body, I would have fallen to the ground and screamed. But I could only burn._
  
_I am sorry for what happened to the 'me' that was. I am sorry for the pain it caused her. But it was the only way to prepare her for my task._
  
_I am the vessel now._" ― Mist
