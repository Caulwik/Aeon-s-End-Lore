#mage
Kadir is a mage from the [[Core set]].

__Core set mat lore:__
"_I am alone in my hunger to explore the deeps. The elders say the ancient tribes once worshiped a sleeping god somewhere in the maze of tunnels and vaults below. I have journeyed farther than any others and seen many an oddity in the pure black silence, but none yet that resembles a god, asleep or otherwise._
  
_There is no peace to be had elsewhere in [[Gravehold]]. Woe fills the air like dust, a patina of dread scattered upon everything. But in the deep, ah, in the deep there is peace. In the deep, there is wisdom that wells up from within as your self dissolves into the emptiness. This is why we take the youngling mages there, to decant their minds, to clear their thoughts, even if only for that single pilgrimage. But I believe our true salvation lies beneath the city. Somewhere in the shadows is a place that even The [[Nameless]] cannot find. One day I will lead them to it, and they too will know peace._" ― Kadir
