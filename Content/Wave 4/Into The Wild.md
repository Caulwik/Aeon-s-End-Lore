__From wiki:__
**Into the Wild** is the third expansion of Aeon's End: [[The New Age]], and requires a standalone set to play with. Its retail release was in December 2019. This expansion contains a continuation of The New Age story with a new narrative expedition, one new nemesis and two new breach mages, as well as new gems, relics, spells, treasures, and minions.

__Into The Wild lore:__
_An ancient [[Nameless]] has begun moving north, spreading death and decay wherever it goes. Only two of the youngest, strongest mages see it coming, a [[Inco|boy from the woods]] who speaks to the plants and a [[Razra|girl]] deeply connected with a [[Rip|wild beast]]. But their opponent may not merely be Nameless alone, but corruption from within._

<u>Mages:</u>
+ [[Inco]]
+ [[Razra]]

<u>Nemesis</u>:
