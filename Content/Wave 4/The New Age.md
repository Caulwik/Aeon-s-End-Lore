__From wiki:__
The New Age is the fourth standalone set in the Aeon's End franchise. It was designed by Kevin Riley, published through Indie Boards and Cards, and released in September 2019. This set comes with all pieces required to play, not needing any other content to work. It can, however, be combined with any other expansion or set. The box contains 8 playable mages, 4 nemeses to fight, 22 sets of supply cards, as well as a brand new type of player card, Treasures. It also introduces a new game mode, Expedition Mode and with it the new upgraded basic nemesis cards.

__The New Age Prologue Lore:__
"_In the aftermath of [[the Fall]], nothing was left except destruction and despair. When [[Gravehold]] Past was buried, our world collapsed, but a spark of perseverance remains even now. The spirit of [[Gravehold]] is her people, and we shall survive on this strange verdant surface. More than survive, [[New Gravehold]] will thrive._" ― The Tale of [[the Fall]], Master [[Brama]], Elder Breach Teacher

The [[Gravehold]] of the past is no more. The city was attacked by [[Maelstrom]], the most powerful Nameless ever seen. [[Dezmodia]] and a team of valiant breach mages worked together to stop it, but their victory came at a great cost. [[Dezmodia]]’s finishing blow was an explosion of such pure, unimaginable energy that it consumed both her and [[Maelstrom]], and all of [[Gravehold]] with them. Her spell was so powerful, and [[Maelstrom]] so massive, that the network of tunnels and cave systems collapsed, but without her sacrifice, humanity itself would be no more. The home of countless generations and the surrounding area were destroyed. Many brave mages who were fighting on the front line were never found.

In spite of their losses, the people of [[Gravehold]] looked to the future with hope. With nowhere to retreat, they turned upward. Led by the remaining breach mages, they made their way to the surface and fought against the ancient [[Nameless]] of this strange new world. They called their new home [[New Gravehold]].

Their efforts were almost in vain when [[Xaxos]], one of their own, betrayed his fellow mages. He sought to use energy from the [[Void]] to gain enough power to stop the [[Nameless]], but it consumed him. When the other mages tried to sway him from this path, he turned on them and they were forced to stop him. In the aftermath of [[Xaxos]]’s betrayal, the [[council of elders]] banished his followers from [[New Gravehold]] forever to stop anyone else from making the same mistakes. With [[Xaxos]] gone and the last known Nameless defeated, the council decreed that all breaches be closed in the hope that it would keep new [[Nameless]] from entering this world. The people toiled and rebuilt in peace amongst the unfamiliar flora of their new surroundings.

Not long after [[New Gravehold]] was formed on the surface, however, more unknown [[Nameless]] emerged from the wilderness. Without breach magic, [[New Gravehold]] was defenseless. Mere decades after closing them, [[New Gravehold]] was forced to reopen the breaches and take up breach magic once more.

No longer willing to merely wait and defend, [[New Gravehold]]’s strongest breach mages have been organized into expedition parties. Many have already set out to find the source of the [[Nameless]] and stop their assault once and for all. The people of [[New Gravehold]] still believe in a future free from [[Nameless]], free from war, and free from the temptation of breach magic once and for all.
