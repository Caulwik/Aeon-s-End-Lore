__From wiki:__
Shattered Dreams is the first expansion of Aeon's End: [[The New Age]], and requires a standalone set to play with. Its retail release was in December 2019. This expansion contains one new nemesis and one new breach mage, as well as new gems, relics, spells, treasures, and minions.

__The Ancients lore:__
_Even the sky above [[New Gravehold]] is not safe. Dark crystals of blue onyx have been spreading like a plague, the dread screams of a [[The Wailing|flying Nameless]] who encases its foes alive. Luckily, a [[Nook|breach scientist]] who lost his grip on time itself may have unlocked something more powerful than ever before._

<u>Mages:</u>
+ [[Nook]]

<u>Nemesis</u>:
+ [[The Wailing]]
