__From wiki:__
Legacy is the second standalone expansion to Aeon's End. The box comes with all pieces required to play, not needing any other content to work. It can, however, be combined with any other expansion or set. The box contains 8 playable mages, 4 nemeses to fight, and 27 sets of supply cards.

__Legacy lore:__
_"You are not breach mages yet," [[Brama]] lectures as she paces down the line of her students, her frail form belying her immense power. "Breach mages have protected us since the beginning ― since the burning of the world and our pilgrimage into the dark. It was they who founded [[Gravehold]], our last bastion, and if you wish to stand beside these living legends, you must listen and learn. The [[Nameless]] shall come again, as the always have, and you will need to be ready. You are the hope of our future"
As a young apprentice, you grew up to stories of the breach mages. [[Brama]], the teacher, wisest of the mages. [[Dezmodia]], the prodigy, master of great magic. [[Mist]], the stoic leader and tactical genius. [[Malastar]], the magical craftsman. Rebellious, powerful, and reckless perfectly sum up [[Xaxos]]. These mages are your heroes and tomorrow, after your [[apprentice's ordeal|ordeal]], you will join their ranks.
"Each of you must overcome your [[apprentice's ordeal|ordeal]] to learn discipline and focus, the tools you will need to defend [[Gravehold]]. We are nothing without [[Gravehold]]. To be a breach mage is to sacrifice your life to [[Gravehold]]. When you die, it will be in defense of our city. Once you understand this universal truth...only then will you be ready to become a mage"_
