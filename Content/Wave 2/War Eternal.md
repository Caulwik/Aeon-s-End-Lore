__From wiki:__
War Eternal is the first standalone expansion to Aeon's End. It was designed by Kevin Riley, published through Indie Boards and Cards, and released in October 2017. The box comes with all pieces required to play, not needing any other content to work. It can, however, be combined with any other expansion or set. The box contains 8 playable mages, 4 nemeses to fight, and 27 sets of supply cards.

__War Eternal lore:__
"_[[Gravehold]] remains the last bastion of [[The World That Was]]. As the otherworldly incursions from the creatures known only as The [[Nameless]] intensify, a cadre of strange survivors emerge from the [[Void|void]] itself. Will they be Gravehold's salvation or its undoing?_"
