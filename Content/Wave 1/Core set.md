__From wiki:__
Aeon's End is the first game from a series of Aeon's End products, and is often referred to as the **Core** or Base set. It was created by Kevin Riley with Action Phase Games and published through Indie Boards & Cards. The Core Set was first released through Kickstarter in November 2016 and had a retail release in September 2017 . A 2nd edition released in 2018, which updated most of the graphic design on the cards and playmats. All content shown here is from the 2nd edition. The box contains 8 playable mages, 4 nemeses to fight, and 27 sets of supply cards.

__Core set lore:__
"_This isn't the end of the world. That already happened. This is what's left. Us,_ [[Gravehold]]_, and_ The [[Nameless]] _- creatures seeking to snatch what little we have left from our group. The breath in our lungs. The weak light in our eyes. For generations we have taken refuge in an ancient and haunted place, one whose first purpose was forgotten for a thousand ages, until our exodus once again filled its empty halls and hovels with our shadows. Here in the darkness, we seek a way back to the light.  
It has taken the breach mages an aeon to hone their dark craft, but they are ready, they are lethal. The breaches, the very conduits through which The [[Nameless]] travel, have become our weapon. The breach mages wield this power with undeniable ambition: to survive, to take back_ [[The World That Was]]_, to protect our home._" ― [[Nerva]], Gravehold survivor
